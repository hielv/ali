Know me when I am a slave
Not when I am king
Don't claim your royalty (Big daddy)
Know me when I am small
Not when I am big
I will stumble over this (Don't call me sugar)
I missed you yesterday
Even when you said
This is not the way
No more playing game
I'm breaking all the chain
We cannot stay the same (We cannot stay the same)

[Chorus]
Fimile, don't call me sugar
Don't touch the fire
Don't give me drama
My best friend lover
When no money
She no give honey
She wan' leave daddy
Big daddy
Fimile, don't call me sugar
Don't touch the fire
Don't give me drama
My best friend lover
When no money
She no give honey
